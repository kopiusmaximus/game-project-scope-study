## User Stories

```md
4-8 user stories for your game project:

As a user, I want to create an account so I can keep track of games I have
played.

As a user, I want to change my password so I can protect my account if I think
my previous password has been compromised.

As a user, I want to sign out so I can protect my account when I'm done playing.

As a user, I want to start a game so I can play Tic-Tac-Toe in the browser
window with a friend.

As a user, I want the game application to "know" the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe so I
can't accidentally make an illegal move or keep playing after a game has ended.

As a user, I want to access all games associated with my account so I can see
how my play has changed over time.

As a user, I want the ability to start a new game at any time so I don't have to
finish games whose eventual outcome is already obvious.
